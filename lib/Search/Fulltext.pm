=head1 NAME

Search::Fulltext - Fulltext search module

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my $query = 'beer';
    my @docs = (
        'I like beer the best',
        'Wine makes people saticefied',  # does not include beer
        'Beer makes people happy',
    );
    
    my $fts = Search::Fulltext->new({
        docs => \@docs,
    });
    my $results = $fts->search($query);
    is_deeply($results, [0, 2]);         # 1st & 3rd doc include 'beer'

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Search::Fulltext is a fulltext search module. It can be used in a few steps.

Languages not separated by white spaces (unlike English, like Japanese) are not supported yet,
although future version would support it.

Currently SQLite's FTS4 is used as an indexer.
Various queries supported by FTS4 (AND, OR, NEAR, ...) are fully provided.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Search::Fulltext->new

=pod

Creates fulltext index for documents.

=over 4

=item C<@param docs> B<[required]>

Reference to array whose contents are document to be searched.

=item C<@param index_file> B<[optional]>

File path to write fulltext index. By default, on-memory index is used.

=item C<@param tokenizer> B<[optional]>

Tokenizer name to use. 'simple' (default) and 'porter' is supported in the current version.
See L<http://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html#tokenizer> for more details on FTS4 tokenizers.
Future release would support Japanese tokenizer.

Other queries below and combination of them can be also used.

    my $results = $fts->search('people NOT beer');
    my $results = $fts->search('make*');
    my $results = $fts->search('"makes people"');
    my $results = $fts->search('beer NEAR happy');
